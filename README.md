## Utopia On Earth, Dystopia in Heaven
Utopia on Earth, Dystopia in Heaven demonstrates my skill as a producer and sound artist. It was created in collaboration with the Listening planet project, a foundation dedicated to preserving the sound of Earth. The work itself conveys the message of either climate salvation or destruction. Throughout the piece, foley and animal sounds mesh together with electronic synthesis, the sounds of humans, and other found objects into a unique cacophonous blend of fear, anger, peace, suffering, and bliss. The work was developed using Ableton Live. 

## Timbral Inflector
Timbral Inflector demonstrates my skill as a programmer and designer. It is a VST device that uses ring modulation and filtering to add unique textures and timbral content to a signal. The device was programmed using JUCE in C++ after first mapping out the digital signal processing with a block diagram.

## Ring Modulation Decomposition and Rn Encoding
Ring Modulation Decomposition and Rn Encoding demonstrates my skill in applied mathematics, design, and research. It outlines a proposed method of lossy data compression, the steps needed to practically implement it, and the potential it possesses. 

## All Along the Highway
All Along the Highway demonstrates my skills as a classically trained composer and orchestrator. The piece of music for symphony orchestra tells a weaving story told through its pastoral, depictive orchestration; it was recorded at a workshop in Duke’s Hall at the Royal Academy of Music. 

## First Contact
First Contact demonstrates my creativity as a programmer and collaborator. The piece of music was performed at the Sound of Contagion workshop at the Universität der Künste Berlin. The work is for violin and electronics, but the piece itself has no permanent score. Instead, an evolutionary algorithm is employed that generates the score that the violinist uses. The piece was conceived of when applying for the conference, but most of the work for the piece was done during the 3 day workshop while receiving feedback from the violinist.
